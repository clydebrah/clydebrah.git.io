Learning HTML coding was tough at first. But as I kept going, I got better at it. I started from the basic tags like the html and the body tag. It wasn't just about remembering the right words, it was also about understanding how websites are built. <br><br>

As I practiced, I saw how HTML works together with CSS and JavaScript to make cool websites. It taught me to pay attention to small details and be organized. This journey helped me not only learn coding but also understand more about the internet. I can now also apply coding to my project like performance tasks. </p></td></tr></table>

This quarter, I learned the importance of linking CSS to HTML and creating hyperlinks to connect different websites. These skills are essential in web development because they allow you to control the appearance of a webpage and make it interactive. Understanding how to structure and connect these components made me realize how websites function behind the scenes.<br><br>

Linking CSS to HTML taught me how design and content work together. By linking CSS, you can style your webpage in a way that makes it more appealing and easier to navigate. This process is essential because it separates the structure (HTML) from the design (CSS), making websites more organized and professional-looking.<br><br>

I also learned about using hyperlinks to connect different pages and websites. Hyperlinks are what make the internet so interconnected. They allow users to jump from one webpage to another easily, whether itâ€™s within the same website or to an entirely different one. This skill is especially important for creating webpages that provide information and resources efficiently.<br><br>

Overall, the second quarter helped me understand the basics of web development in a practical way. Learning these skills made me appreciate how much thought and detail goes into creating even the simplest of websites. It also inspired me to explore web development further and see how I can improve my projects in the future.</p></td></tr></table>
