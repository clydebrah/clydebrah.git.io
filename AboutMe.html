I’m Adrian Clyde Dacoco, 14 years old, and I’m not the type of person who enjoys going to school. Spending 9 to 10 hours in a classroom feels like a waste of time, especially when it’s followed by two more hours of homework. Honestly, I don’t see the point of dedicating so much of my day to something that doesn’t really help me grow in the way I want to.<br><br>

What I love is lifting weights. When I’m at the gym, I feel like I’m actually doing something meaningful, building strength, discipline, and pushing myself to become better every day. It’s not just about getting stronger physically; it’s about knowing that my time and effort are directly contributing to something tangible. School doesn’t give me that same satisfaction.<br><br>

To me, sitting through endless classes and assignments feels like my time is being stolen. I could be spending those hours at the gym, focusing on my goals and improving myself. School just feels like a repetitive cycle of tasks that don’t connect to my passions or the future I envision for myself.<br><br>

I believe that life should be about pursuing what you love, and for me, that’s bodybuilding. Instead of being forced into a routine that drains my energy and wastes my time, I’d rather focus on what truly makes me happy and helps me grow.<br><br>
